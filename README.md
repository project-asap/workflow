Setup
-----
For demostration reasons a Linux operating system like Ubuntu it is assumed in this step. In Windows or other Linux distributions the equivalents should be done.

The project uses [nginx](http://nginx.org/), [php-fpm](http://php-fpm.org/) and [python](https://www.python.org/). To install these packages execute the command:
`sudo apt-get nginx php-fpm python`

The project's root directory stores a configuration file for nginx: `wmt.conf.default`.
It should be changed appropriately: on line 5 `set $ROOT "/your/path/to/wmt";`.
Then you can use this file for nginx server configuration:
`ln -s ~/your/path/to/wmt/wmt.conf /your/nginx/installation/servers/`

To build the project use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Installation of Grunt's command line interface (CLI) globally can be done with the following commands:

1.  `sudo apt-get npm`
2.  `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`

The project is configured with a `package.json` and a `Gruntfile.js`, it's very easy to start working with Grunt:

1.  Go to the project's root directory.
2.  Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
3.  Run Grunt with `grunt`.

Tests
-----
To run tests, do `python -m unittest -v testmain` in the directory `pub/py/`
Currently, the following functions have test coverage:

1. `analyse()` - comparison of its result with the presaved result in a file testwl-a.json
2. `save()` - checking that save function generates a file with correct name
3. `execute()` - checking that execute function saves a workflow in IReS format (correct folder and presence of required files in it)
4. `findNode()` - checking that found node with findNode function has correct id
5. `findTask()` - checking that found task with findTask function has correct id
6. `findEdge()` - checking that found edge with findEdge function has correct id
7. `dict2text()` - comparison of its result with the presaved result

Usage of a tool
---------------

### Workflow Design

Creating a workflow from scratch can be done by following steps:

1.  First, click new workflow on the top of the page.
2.  Then, create a graph of a workflow: add nodes and datastores using buttons add datastore and add node;
    connect them using button add links, when it is pressed —Ålicking on the first then the second nodes adds an edge between them.
3.  Add tasks into the nodes: choose a node;
    click add task on the left sidebar;
    choose from the list of operators and then edit metadata to your needs.
4.  Save the workflow, click save workflow on the top navbar.
